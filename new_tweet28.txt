 rrb senior section engineer and junior engineer kab recuirt ksrenga??? 3 saal ho gye hai. no response , unemployment at its peak now. kuch dhyan dijiye is par bhi.
 is still 5% discount on booking tickets on atvm but there is no discount on booking through uts. atvm vs uts, in uts there is no investment on machine / ribbon / ticket roll / some time railway staff also do book tickets for passenger. 1.
 actually there is more saving as compare to atvm so there must be discount on ticket booking through uts, infact there should be higher discount on uts as there is zero investment on infrastructure. so looking positive response at the earliest. 2.
 suggestion- bill should be made in duplicate with endorsement of passenger pnr who purchased food. insp. verify vendor copy of food bill with pnr, if their is no pnr on bill it may be false. pnr on bill, will stop false bill making and overcharging. thanks
